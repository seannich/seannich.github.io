          <b>update me please</b> <br />
          I am currently pursuing a Diploma in Information Technology in Ngee
          Ann Polytechnic. Previously graduated from ITE College Central with a
          Higher Nitec in Information Technology certificate. I am independent,
          active, and willing to learn.

          <b>update me please</b> <br />ÃŽ I took a MBTI personality test at
          16Personalities and according to their website, I have a ISTP-A /
          ISTP-T or a "Virtuoso" personality.

          old stuff:An ISTP-A / ISTP-T or a "Virtuoso" personality is bold and
          practical and known for technical mastery and willingness to
          improvise. Virtuosos are good at finding unique solutions to seemingly
          impossible challenges. Virtuosos' desire to explore and learn new
          things is invaluable in many areas, including their own personal
          growth. On the contrary, Virtuosos can be easily tripped up in areas
          where their focus on practical matters is more of a liability than an
          asset. Where it is finding (or keeping) a partner, reaching dazzling
          heights on the career ladder, or learning to plan ahead, Virtuosos
          need to put in a conscious effort to develop their weaker traits and
          additional skills.

          I took another personality test which was the RIASEC personality test
          by Rouge Community College and according to them, my results were:
        </b-card-text>
        <ol>
          <li>Artistic with a score of 12</li>
          <li>Realistic with a score of 11</li>
          <li>Conventional with a score of 8</li>
          <li>Social with a score of 8</li>
          <li>Investigative with a score of 7</li>
          <li>Enterprising with a score of 3</li>
        </ol>
        <b-card-text>
          They also stated that based on my results, the preferred work
          environment would be artistic, one that is non-conforming, original,
          independent, chaotic and creative.
