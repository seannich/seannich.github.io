          During the Covid-19 pandemic, I had just started my internship in SPH.
          During this period of time, it was also time for the media outlets to
          get ready for the Singapore's General Election.

          My first project was to create an infographic that was about the
          things that Singaporeans didn't know they needed to know about the
          General Elections. The instructions given to me was to create
          something similar to how instagram stories are viewed. I worked with
          my colleagues on this project and you can view it

          My second project was to create an infographic that listed all the
          events that were related to the General Elections in a familiar format
          so that viewers could click on a specific date and view all events on
          that day. The instructions given to me was to create an interactive
          calendar that allowed users to click on specific dates, view events,
          as well as add them to their own clanedar if possible. I didn't do
          this project alone and you can view it

          My third project was to help out with the FAQ page and I contributed
          by adding an animation on the dropdowns to ease in the answers instead
          of having the answer pop in from nowhere. You can view this project
