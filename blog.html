                    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

                    <h3>002: A REALISATION</h3>
                    <p>I realised that there are many designs that I would love to try while using this page personally. So to anyone that views this, you would probably see many changes in the website design.</p>
                    <p>Some ideas would be colour coding the posts so that its easier to know which category they belong to. E.g. green for school related posts and white for personal posts. I currently have an idea to use a menu to navigate through the website but since I'm so busy with school and CCAs and work, it would take some time to update the design of the website. </p>
